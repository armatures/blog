Janusz Welin has a series of meditations on sleep I discovered through the Brightmind app. I have only listened to a couple of them, but I found his ideas useful for falling asleep. I would find myself struggling to fall asleep, realize that my mind was racing and stressed, and try to change the focus of my attention in the ways he recommends. The problem, though, was that I could never remember the list of recommendations! With practice, I've gotten better, but at the start, it took a lot of effort for me to remember what I wanted to do to sleep. So I decided to draw a picture encoding the recommendations
