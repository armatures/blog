title: Decision Trees as a Teaching Tool
---

Recently I encountered the idea of [fast-and-frugal trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-and-frugal_trees) through [an Econtalk conversation with Gerd Gigerenzer](https://www.econtalk.org/gerd-gigerenzer-on-gut-feelings/). I have long been interested in graphical representations of information and I want to explore applications of this idea.

## What's This, Then?

A first take on a fast-and-frugal tree<label for="sn-thanks" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="sn-thanks" class="margin-toggle">
  <span class="sidenote">
Tree-rendering thanks goes to Justus Wilhelm's great post [Hakyll on Netlify](https://www.justus.pw/posts/2019-09-01-hakyll-on-netlify.html) and the [repo for that blog](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website), which is open-source</span>:
```graphviz
digraph {
  "Are any ideas in the market viable?" -> "Have you syndicated any of them?" [ label="yes" ]
  }
```
