I wonder if part of the problem with the IRS tax forms is the lack of abstraction.
Instructions are always framed in terms of references to other schedules and forms and their resulting sums, without explaining the higher-level strategy.

Let's start with the simplest possible income tax policy, and then add some policy goals, and see how that complicates things.

## The simplest possible income tax

We will start with a flat tax. For every dollar a person makes, our government takes 10% of that dollar. 
```graphviz
    strict digraph {
          income [label="income"]
          tax [label="tax = 0.1 * income"]

      income -> tax
    }
```

We have one input and one output. This is simple, and though people would still have to track lots of sources of income, nobody is going to get lost in the math.

## The simplest progressive income tax

This would be an unusual tax policy: most tax regimes take a higher percentage of wealthier tax payers' income, because these tax payers are more capable of paying.
Let's introduce the smallest possible change to our tax policy to address this. 

```graphviz
    strict digraph {
          income [label="income"]
          isTaxed [label="> 20,000?"]
          noTax [label="tax = 0"]
          tax [label="tax = (income - 20,000) * 0.2"]

      income -> isTaxed
      isTaxed -> noTax [color="red"]
      isTaxed -> tax [color="chartreuse"]
    }
```

"20,000" shows up twice in this graph. We can define a term "taxableIncome" to remove this duplication:

```graphviz
    strict digraph {
          income [label="income - 20,000"]
          isTaxed [label="> 0?"]
          noTax [label="tax = 0"]
          tax [label="tax = taxableIncome * 0.2"]

      income -> isTaxed [label="taxableIncome"]
      isTaxed -> noTax [color="red"]
      isTaxed -> tax [color="chartreuse"]
    }
```

The functional form of this tax is a little trickier than our initial tax policy: it is not continuous, so it takes a little more work to write:

      {0.2} (x - 20,000) &amp; 20,000\leq x
   \end{cases}</annotation></semantics></math></p>

I can think of two reasonable ways to graph these two simple tax policies: a graph of the total tax, or a representation of the marginal rate. Here's a graph of the first option: the flat tax is in blue, and the simple progressive tax is in red. To use such a graph, find a level of income on the x axis. The y-axis shows the tax obligation for this income level.

Another option is to show the tax rate itself, rather than the total tax obligation, on the y-axis. This is _not_ useful for a tax payer trying to find their tax obligation, but this illustrates a common misconception about tax brackets. Obviously, the big jump at $20,000 is significant, and it's easy for a naive reader to see this graph and think they are looking at their tax rate on the y-axis. In reality, they're looking at their _marginal_ rate on the y-axis, and they need to calculate the area under the line to the left of their income if they want to find their total tax obligation.
you might find this form more intuitive<label for="sn-derivative" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="sn-derivative" class="margin-toggle">
  <span class="sidenote">
  Mathy readers will notice that this is a graph of the derivative of the previous graph.
  </span>
.

This is the simplest and most intuitive representation of income tax I can come up with, and it seems much better than the usual exhaustive tabular representation.

Why don't we see any attempts at making tax policy more approachable?
The IRS has a full plate defining and enforcing tax policy: their mission probably doesn't include education, or trying to make things more approachable. But, it _would_ be cheaper for them to have people do their taxes right the first time. Probably. Assuming this is the case, this feels like a valuable approach. A functional form of a tax like this would save people from looking up the tax they owe in a [dreadful table](). In any case, just graphing the tax like this would do a lot to help people understand what "progressive marginal income tax" means.
