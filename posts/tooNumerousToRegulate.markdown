Here is a sidenote. Turns out I think I want this to be inline-able:

<span class="marginnote">
   a sidenote?
</span>

<span class="marginnote">
  with two paras?
</span>



```sidenote
  neat note
```
Also my friend John had this interesting idea:
!["tooBigOrNumerousToRegulate"](/static/tooBigOrNumerousToRegulate.svg "Too Numerous To Fail")
