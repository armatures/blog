Over the last few years of living in Minneapolis, there has been a substantial amount of conversation about the new Vikings stadium, particularly about its cost (substantial) and its toll on migrating birds (uncertain). In 2017, the Audubon Chapter of Minneapolis published a study they performed during the Fall migration season in 2016, concluding “this level of migratory bird mortality … will establish U.S.Bank Stadium as the top bird-killing building in the Twin Cities.”

Lots of people are paying attention to the risk to birds presented by the US Bank Stadium, and the Vikings funded "a two-year, $300,000 bird collision study"

 to quantify that threat. This was performed by Loss et al. and observed the stadium for 6 weeks, finding 111 dead birds near the stadium.

    They conducted surveys at the buildings in the study for six months, and though these observation times include the peak migration times, this isn't the full toll the stadium takes on birds annually.

  It looks like the Loss et. al report resulted in 2 papers: [one hosted by the MSFA](https://www.msfa.com/content/Audubon/Stadium%20Study%20Final%20Report[1].pdf) and prepared with them as an audience, and [one published in PLOS, an open-access publisher](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224164). The MSFA one gives some suggested window treatments, and I looked at their first suggested treatment, CollidEscape. The ceiling on cost of materials for all the stadium's windows given the listed prices on their website would be around $600,000, and though there should be ways to cut down on that number, I'm not sure what installation costs would be, so lets take that as a very rough cost estimate.

    200,000 square feet of glass, according to the Audubon Chapter of Minneapolis' initial report presented on February 24, 2017. The listed price for 50 square feet of "CollidEscape Guaranteed - White" treatment is $149. 200,000 * (149/50) = $596,000. I imagine buying 4,000 of these would lower the price substantially. I don't have a good estimate of installation costs.

  I will take the life of the stadium to be 31 years.

    This is the lifetime of the Vikings' last stadium, the Metrodome, used by the Vikings from 1982-2013.

  This might be money well spent, but 
  How large a threat is this, relative to other threats to birds?
 Cats are a larger threat to birds
	from [Loss' previous work with Will & Marra](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380/tables/1):
		per feral cat bird predation is roughly $$(51.4 + 24.4)/2 = 37.9$$ birds per cat annually
		owned cats with outdoor access is roughly $$(1.0 + 34.1) /2 =  17.55$$ birds per cat annually
  The latest US Bank study gives an estimate of 111 dead birds a year
		This is $$111/37 = 3 $$ feral cats worth of birds.
		This is $$111/17.55 = 6.3$$ owned cats worth of birds.
What is the most cost-effective way to save birds?
